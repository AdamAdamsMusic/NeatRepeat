## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2023-11-07

### Added

- Added changelog tracking

### Changed

- Changed the name to NeatRepeat

## 0.1.5 - 2023-11-07

### Added

- Different (MIDI) Ch. for re-trigger
  - Since not having separate note instances is a limitation of the MIDI protocol, when the script sends a lot of MIDI NoteOn/NoteOff messages for the exact same key – it gets really confusing and some notes are cut off, while the other hang indefinitely. The workaround is to send the re-triggered notes on a different MIDI channel, so they don't interfere. This allows for proper re-triggering without artifacts, but comes with its own limitations (especially visible with VEP/multitimbral setup users).

## 0.1.4 - 2023-11-07

### Fixed

- Script now allows any other MIDI message (e.g. MIDI CC) to be bypassed without processing, instead of filtering them out

## 0.1.3 - 2023-11-07

### Added

- Script now kills (sends NoteOff for) the previously sounding note of the same number, in order to trigger another one – removing the overlay issue

## 0.1.2 - 2023-11-07

### Changed

- Now the trigger key note behaves as it should, instead of having a NoteOff sent after a fixed amount of time

## 0.1.1 - 2023-11-07

### Added

- Delay between NoteOn and NoteOff is now calculated automatically, based on the note you hit before the trigger key

### Removed

- Removed the NoteOff delay slider

### Fixed

- Choosing trigger key from the menu didn't work

## 0.1.0 - 2023-11-05

- initial release
